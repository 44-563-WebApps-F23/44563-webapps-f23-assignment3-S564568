        <h3>Vacation Spot: Kashmir</h3>
        <p>
            The <b>Kashmir Valley</b>, also known as the Vale of Kashmir, is an intermontane valley in northern Jammu and Kashmir.
            <b>The Kashmir Valley has a moderate climate</b>, which is largely defined by its geographic location, 
            with the towering Karakoram Range in the north, Pir Panjal Range in the south and west, and Zanskar Range in the east. It can be generally described as cool in the spring and autumn, mild in the summer and cold in the winter. As a large valley with significant differences in geo-location among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly areas compared to the flat lower parts.
